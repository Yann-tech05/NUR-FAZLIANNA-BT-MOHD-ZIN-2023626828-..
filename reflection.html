		<td>During the development of this website, I made several design choices to ensure that the layout was clean, user friendly, and visually appealing. I used a background image for the website to make it more engaging, while keeping the text and tables clear for readability.</td>

    <tr>
    	<td>One of the challenges I faced was making the images and tables responsive and aligned properly across different pages. I also had to ensure that the navigation buttons were simple yet functional, so users could easily move between pages without confusion.But I face another challenge when I press the "back to home" button at any pages, the alert button will show up again and it is lowkey annoyed me.</td>

    	<td>From this project, I learned the importance of planning the structure before coding, managing CSS for consistency across multiple pages, and the value of simplicity in design. This experience helped me develop both technical skills in HTML as well as problem solving and attention to detail.</td>
